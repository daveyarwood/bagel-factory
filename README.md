This is my experiment: writing a bookmarklet in ClojureScript, along with a Boot task that will spit out an HTML file containing the bookmarklet link that will run the JavaScript.

**UNDER CONSTRUCTION**

Step 1 is to get the Boot task pipeline working -- once I've got that, I will break it out into a standalone Boot task.

Step 2 is to use the Boot task to write a bookmarklet (in ClojureScript) that replaces programming terms with breakfast terms.
